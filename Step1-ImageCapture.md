# How to Digitize a Historical Dictionary

### Step 1: Image Capture

Convert the dictionary into a PDF image document by scanning it. You can do this non-destructively or destructively. 

__Non-destructive Scanning__

If the dictionary is rare or valuable-- often the case for historical documents, non-destructive is your only option. Find a book scanning or document archival business who can do this for you. For our project, we used [Bound Book Scanning](https://boundbookscanning.com/) (New York). These firms typically use special hardware to scan books with minimal stress on the book's spine, a plus if you are concerned about preserving your dictionary. Alternatively you can scan the book yourself.  

__Destructive Scanning__

Consider destructive scanning if you can obtain the dictionary inexpensively. This involves cutting the book's spine then feeding the loose pages into a scanner. Destructive scanning can be a faster and cheaper option. Businesses such as [1DollarScan](https://1dollarscan.com/) (San Jose, California) provide this service for a reasonable fee. If you want to do it yourself, you can find plenty of instructions online.

# How to Retro-Digitize a Historical Dictionary

## Step 3.4: Proofread the OCR-ed Pages

This step is very mechanical. For each OCR-ed page, you:

- Open the page in your preferred text editor
- Compare the page's content against the corresponding source PDF and fix any OCR mistakes
- Save the corrected text file

> __Exercise:__ &nbsp;Proofread the following (as much as you'd like :-)
>
> | OCR-ed Page | Original PDF |
> | --- | ----------- |
> | trained-01.txt | sample-01.pdf |
> | trained-02.txt | sample-02.pdf |
> | trained-03.txt | sample-03.pdf |
> | trained-04.txt | sample-04.pdf |
> | trained-05.txt | sample-05.pdf |
&nbsp;

Check your work by comparing them with our proofread pages below (located in _tutorial/CorrectedPages_). Use a file comparison tool such as [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) (runs on Ubuntu, Mac OS & Windows) to do a "visual diff".

- [sample-01-REF.txt](./tutorial/CorrectedPages/sample-01-REF.txt)
- [sample-02-REF.txt](./tutorial/CorrectedPages/sample-02-REF.txt)
- [sample-03-REF.txt](./tutorial/CorrectedPages/sample-03-REF.txt)
- [sample-04-REF.txt](./tutorial/CorrectedPages/sample-04-REF.txt)
- [sample-05-REF.txt](./tutorial/CorrectedPages/sample-05-REF.txt)

For your own project, you will need to proofread the entire dictionary so plan accordingly.

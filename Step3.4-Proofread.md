# How to Retro-Digitize a Historical Dictionary

## Step 3.4: Proofread the OCR-ed Pages

This step is very mechanical. For each OCR-ed page, you:

- Open the page in your preferred text editor
- Compare the page's content against the corresponding source PDF and fix any OCR mistakes
- Save the corrected text file

> __Exercise:__ &nbsp;Proofread the following.
>
> | OCR-ed Page | Original PDF |
> | --- | ----------- |
> | page-00xx-OCR.txt | page-00xx.pdf |
> | page-00xx-OCR.txt | page-00xx.pdf |
> | page-00xx-OCR.txt | page-00xx.pdf |
&nbsp;

Check your work by comparing them with our proofread pages below. Use a file comparison tool such as [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) (runs on Ubuntu, Mac OS & Windows) to do a "visual diff".

- page-00xx-REF.txt
- page-00xx-REF.txt
- page-00xx-REF.txt

For your own project, you will need to proofread the entire dictionary so plan accordingly.
